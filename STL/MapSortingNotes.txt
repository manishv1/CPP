1. map/unordered_map does not support any function to sort data 
2. There is one function through which you can convered map to pair of vectors 
     
          vector< pair<int,int> > v(mp.begin(), mp.end())
    Change the data tyeps based on the map key , value datatype.
    This compatibility is because we have first and second field in map and we have first and second field in pair of vector.

    Now to sort the map we can sort the first and second field of the pair of vector

    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), comp)  

    cmp function is defined below : 

    int cmp(pair<int,int> a, pair<int,int> b)
    {
        return a.second < b.second;
    }
